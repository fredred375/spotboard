Usage
-----

Spotboard consists of two main modules: a static **web application** (frontend),
and the **feedserver** (backend: API server) that provides the contest information.

### Frontend: [Web Application][src-webapp]

Download [a webapp package](https://github.com/spotboard/spotboard/releases), and serve it using any HTTP server.
We recommend `http-server -c-1` (disable cache) or `nginx`.
A path to the API server and many other preferences can be configured in [config.js][config_sample].

### Backend: FeedServer

The feedserver should provide the contest information and all the runs (submissions) during the contest,
[in JSON][json_sample].
For common contest systems such as [PC^2] or [Domjudge], please see below.

Disclaimer: Some of internal API specifications might be not backward-compatible.

Backend: Domjudge

You may find [spotboard/domjudge-converter] useful.

Backend: PC^2

Disclaimer: This part is not yet open-sourced, sorry :)

*TL;DR)* Setup the `config.yaml`, then launch the spotboard server application.

```
$ vim config.yaml
$ java -jar spotboard-server.jar
```

<!--
- The web application can be hosted using commonly-used web servers such as Nginx and Apache,
  or using the embedded web server provided. See the [detailed documentation](docs/webapp.md).
- The feedserver should provide the contest information and all the runs (submissions) during the contest.
  It is shipped with *off-the-shelf* bridges to other programming contest systems such as PC^2.
  See the [detailed documentation](docs/feedserver.md).
